const mockAIResponse = `Here are three nutrition approaches (Conservative, Standard, Aggressive) tailored for your profile and goal to reduce body fat from 16% to under 10% by October 12, 2025, while maintaining running performance for the Manchester half marathon. Your current stats: 33-year-old male, 177 cm, 90 kg, 16% BF, training 15h/week (10h strength + 5h running), enhanced TDEE 1282 active calories/day, aiming for a weekly deficit of 3500 kcal.

---

### 1. Conservative Approach

- Daily Calories: ~2,500 kcal  
- Weekly Weight Loss Rate: ~0.3 kg/week (approx. 0.7 lbs/week)  
- Timeline Assessment:  
  - At 0.3 kg/week, ~18 weeks (~4.5 months) needed  
  - Completion date: ~Late December 2025 (slightly beyond race date)  

---

### 2. Standard Approach

- Daily Calories: ~2,300 kcal  
- Weekly Weight Loss Rate: ~0.5 kg/week (approx. 1.1 lbs/week)  
- Timeline Assessment:  
  - At 0.5 kg/week, ~11 weeks (~2.5 months) needed  
  - Completion date: Late October 2025 (just after race day)  

---

### 3. Aggressive Approach

- Daily Calories: ~2,000 kcal  
- Weekly Weight Loss Rate: ~0.75‚Äì1.0 kg/week (1.6‚Äì2.2 lbs/week)  
- Timeline Assessment:  
  - At 0.8 kg/week, ~7 weeks (~1.5 months) needed  
  - Completion date: Early September 2025 (well before race date)`;
