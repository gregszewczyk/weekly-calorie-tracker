Let me analyze the query carefully. I'm being asked to provide structured nutrition recommendations for an athlete who is in a cutting phase. The query specifies that I should 
provide direct recommendations only, with no explanations or analysis, and to use a specific format.

The athlete profile:
- 33-year-old male
- 88kg, 177cm, 15% body fat
- Strength-training athlete with 2-5 years experience (intermediate level)
- 14 hours of training per week across 10 sessions
- Goal: cut with a weekly target of 3392 calories deficit
- Target date: October 12, 2025
- Performance Mode: YES (prioritize training performance)
- Target body fat: 10-12%
- Selected TDEE (ENHANCED): 3230 kcal/day (this is the baseline I must use)

I need to calculate three different calorie levels:
1. Conservative: 2300 kcal/day
2. Standard: 2100 kcal/day (marked as recommended)
3. Aggressive: 1900 kcal/day

For each, I need to calculate:
- Protein, carbs, and fats in grams and relative to body weight
- Carb adjustments for training vs rest days
- Weekly deficit and timeline
- Strength-training specifics (pre/post workout nutrition, hydration)
- Supplements
- Monitoring guidelines

Let me calculate each component:

First, I need to determine the deficit percentages:
- Conservative: 2300 kcal/day from TDEE of 3230 = 930 kcal deficit per day = 28.8% deficit
- Standard: 2100 kcal/day = 1130 kcal deficit per day = 35.0% deficit
- Aggressive: 1900 kcal/day = 1330 kcal deficit per day = 41.2% deficit

However, the user specified a weekly target deficit of 3392 calories, which equals 484.6 calories per day (3392 √∑ 7). This seems inconsistent with the calorie levels they want 
me to calculate (2300, 2100, 1900). Let me double-check:

If TDEE is 3230 kcal/day:
- 3230 - 2300 = 930 kcal/day deficit = 6510 kcal/week deficit
- 3230 - 2100 = 1130 kcal/day deficit = 7910 kcal/week deficit
- 3230 - 1900 = 1330 kcal/day deficit = 9310 kcal/week deficit

But the user specified a weekly target of 3392 calories deficit, which is much smaller than what these calorie levels would produce. This is confusing.

Let me re-read the query: "Weekly Target: 3392 calories deficit". This seems unusually small for a weekly deficit. Typically, a 3500 kcal deficit equals about 1 pound of fat loss. A 3392 kcal weekly deficit would only lead to about 0.97 pounds of fat loss per week, which is quite conservative.

However, the calorie levels they want me to calculate (2300, 2100, 1900) would create much larger deficits. Let me calculate what daily intake would match their specified weekly deficit:

3392 kcal/week √∑ 7 = 484.6 kcal/day deficit
3230 - 484.6 = 2745.4 kcal/day

This is significantly higher than the calorie levels they want me to calculate (2300, 2100, 1900). There seems to be a discrepancy here.

Let me check the query again: "Weekly Target: 3392 calories deficit". This could be a typo. 3392 kcal/day would be an enormous deficit (over 1 million kcal/week), which doesn't make sense. 3392 kcal/week is possible but quite small.

Given the instructions to use the specified calorie levels (2300, 2100, 1900), I'll proceed with those, even though they don't match the stated weekly target deficit of 3392 calories.

Now, let's calculate the macronutrient breakdowns:

For all scenarios, I need to prioritize protein to maintain muscle mass during the cut, 
especially since performance is a priority.

General guidelines for strength athletes in a cut:
- Protein: 2.2-2.6g/kg body weight (I'll use 2.4g/kg as a standard)
- Fats: 20-30% of total calories
- Carbs: Remaining calories

Let's calculate for each scenario:

**Conservative: 2300 kcal/day**

Protein: 88kg √ó 2.4g/kg = 211g protein
- Calories from protein: 211g √ó 4 kcal/g = 844 kcal

Fats: Let's aim for 25% of total calories
- Calories from fats: 2300 √ó 0.25 = 575 kcal
- Grams of fats: 575 √∑ 9 = 64g

Carbs: Remaining calories
- Calories from carbs: 2300 - 844 - 575 = 881 kcal
- Grams of carbs: 881 √∑ 4 = 220g

So:
- Protein: 211g (2.4g/kg)
- Carbs: 220g (2.5g/kg)
- Fats: 64g (25%)

For carb cycling:
- Training days: +30g carbs (standard practice)
- Rest days: -30g carbs

Weekly deficit:
- Daily deficit: 3230 - 2300 = 930 kcal
- Weekly deficit: 930 √ó 7 = 6510 kcal

Timeline:
- To lose 1 kg of fat, need ~7700 kcal deficit
- Assuming target is to go from 15% to 11% body fat (4% of 88kg = 3.52kg fat)
- Total deficit needed: 3.52 √ó 7700 = 27,104 kcal
- Weeks needed: 27,104 √∑ 6510 = 4.2 weeks

But this timeline seems too short. Let me double-check:
- Current body fat: 15% of 88kg = 13.2kg fat
- Target body fat: 11% of 88kg = 9
