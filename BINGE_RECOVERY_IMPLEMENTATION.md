## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Core Components Created

#### 1. Type System (`src/types/RecoveryTypes.ts`)
```typescript
// Main interfaces implemented
- OvereatingEvent: Tracks incidents with severity classification
- RecoveryPlan: Comprehensive recovery strategies
- RecoverySession: Active recovery tracking
- RecoveryState: Complete state management
- RebalancingOption: Multiple recovery approaches
```

#### 2. Calculation Engine (`src/services/BingeRecoveryCalculator.ts`)
```typescript
// Core algorithms implemented
- detectOvereatingEvent(): Auto-detection with severity levels
- createRecoveryPlan(): Multiple rebalancing strategies
- calculateImpactAnalysis(): Mathematical perspective framing
- generateRebalancingOptions(): 3-7 day recovery plans
```

#### 3. UI Components
- **BingeRecoveryModal**: Full recovery plan selection interface
- **RecoveryIntegration**: Embeddable component for any screen
- **RecoveryDemoScreen**: Complete testing environment

#### 4. State Integration (`src/stores/calorieStore.ts`)
- Recovery state added to CalorieStore
- Auto-detection integrated into meal logging
- Persistent recovery history and settings
- Active session progress tracking

## 🔍 Detection System

### Automatic Triggers
- **Mild**: 200-500 calories over target
- **Moderate**: 500-1000 calories over target  
- **Severe**: 1000+ calories over target

### Integration Points
- Triggers automatically in `logMeal()` function
- Real-time detection after each meal entry
- Smart threshold-based classification

## 📊 Mathematical Reframing Approach

### Impact Analysis
```
Instead of: "I ruined everything!"
Shows: "This adds 1.8 days to your timeline"

Instead of: "I'm a failure!"  
Shows: "This is 15% of your weekly deficit"

Instead of: "I'll never reach my goal!"
Shows: "This is 0.3% of your total 12-week journey"
```

### Recovery Options Generated
1. **Gentle 7-Day Rebalance** (Recommended)
   - Minimal daily reduction (~71 cal/day)
   - High success rate, no hunger impact

2. **Moderate 5-Day Correction**
   - Balanced effort level
   - Faster recovery timeline

3. **Quick 3-Day Recovery** (Small overages only)
   - Aggressive approach
   - Requires strong discipline

4. **Maintenance Week** (Severe cases)
   - Zero additional stress
   - Prevents restrict-binge cycles

## 🎨 User Experience

### Visual Design
- Color-coded severity indicators (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Expandable option cards with pros/cons
- Mathematical impact visualization
- Progress tracking for active sessions

### Messaging Strategy
- Non-judgmental, fact-based language
- Perspective-building calculations
- Positive reinforcement messages
- Success reminders and motivation

## 🔧 How to Access RecoveryIntegration Component

### Method 1: Add to Existing Screen
```tsx
import RecoveryIntegration from '../components/RecoveryIntegration';

const YourScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      {/* Your existing content */}
      
      <RecoveryIntegration />
      
      {/* More content */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Method 2: Test with Demo Screen
```tsx
// Import and use the demo screen
import RecoveryDemoScreen from '../screens/RecoveryDemoScreen';

// Add to your navigation or render directly
<RecoveryDemoScreen />
```

### Method 3: Manual Integration
```tsx
import { useCalorieStore } from '../stores/calorieStore';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { 
    getPendingOvereatingEvent,
    getActiveRecoverySession,
    createRecoveryPlan 
  } = useCalorieStore();
  
  const pendingEvent = getPendingOvereatingEvent();
  
  // Handle recovery flow manually
};
```

## 🚀 Testing the System

### 1. Using Demo Screen
- Navigate to `RecoveryDemoScreen`
- Use "Trigger Overeating Event" button
- Test different scenarios and recovery options

### 2. Manual Testing
- Log a high-calorie meal (800+ calories)
- System should auto-detect overeating
- Recovery alert appears automatically
- Select recovery plan and start session

### 3. Integration Testing
- Add `<RecoveryIntegration />` to any screen
- Log meals normally
- Recovery alerts appear when thresholds exceeded

## 📱 Integration Examples

### Weekly Dashboard
```tsx
const WeeklyDashboard = () => (
  <ScrollView>
    <WeeklyProgress />
    <RecoveryIntegration />  {/* Add here */}
    <CalorieTargets />
  </ScrollView>
);
```

### Daily Logging Screen
```tsx
const DailyLog = () => (
  <View>
    <MealLogging />
    <RecoveryIntegration />  {/* Auto-shows after overeating */}
    <DailyProgress />
  </View>
);
```

### Settings/Health Screen
```tsx
const HealthScreen = () => (
  <ScrollView>
    <HealthMetrics />
    <RecoveryIntegration />  {/* Shows active sessions */}
    <GoalTracking />
  </ScrollView>
);
```

## 🔄 Automatic Workflow

1. **User logs meal** → `logMeal()` called
2. **Auto-detection** → `checkForOvereatingEvent()` runs
3. **Event created** → Added to recovery state
4. **UI updates** → `RecoveryIntegration` shows alert
5. **User interaction** → Taps alert to see options
6. **Modal opens** → `BingeRecoveryModal` displays plans
7. **Selection** → User chooses recovery approach
8. **Session starts** → Active tracking begins
9. **Progress tracking** → Daily targets adjusted

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Users
- **Reduces panic** through mathematical reframing
- **Prevents restrict-binge cycles** with maintenance options
