## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. GarminAIContextService (420+ lines)

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive AI context from Garmin training and recovery data

**Key Features**:
- **Training Load Analysis**: Acute/chronic training load ratio calculations using TSS methodology
- **Recovery Metrics**: Multi-factor recovery assessment (body battery, sleep, stress)
- **Activity Pattern Analysis**: Sport-specific training analysis and volume tracking
- **Fitness Trends**: VO2 max, lactate threshold, and performance trends

**Core Methods**:
```typescript
generateEnhancedContext(athleteProfile: AthleteProfile, analysisDate?: Date): Promise<GarminEnhancedContext>
calculateTrainingLoad(recentActivities: GarminActivity[]): TrainingLoadMetrics
calculateRecoveryMetrics(dailySummaries: GarminDailySummary[], sleepData: GarminSleepSummary[]): RecoveryMetrics
analyzeActivityPatterns(recentActivities: GarminActivity[]): ActivitySummary
```

**Training Stress Score Implementation**:
- **Acute Load**: 7-day weighted average of training stress
- **Chronic Load**: 28-day weighted average for fitness baseline
- **TSS Ratio**: Acute/chronic ratio for training load assessment
- **Optimal Range**: 0.8-1.3 ratio for sustainable training progression

### 2. Enhanced PerplexityService

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Garmin Data Integration**: Rich context building with training load and recovery data
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated prompt construction with Garmin-specific adjustments
- **Recovery-Based Recommendations**: Calorie and macro adjustments based on body battery and sleep quality

**New Methods**:
```typescript
buildGarminDataSection(context: GarminEnhancedContext): string
buildGarminAdjustmentGuidance(context: GarminEnhancedContext): string
```

**Prompt Enhancement**:
- Training load status and recommendations
- Recovery metrics and calorie adjustments
- Sport-specific periodization guidance
- Body battery-based nutrition timing

### 3. useGarminEnhancedAI React Hook

**Purpose**: Integrate enhanced AI recommendations with React components

**Key Functions**:
- `getEnhancedRecommendations()`: Main recommendation function with Garmin integration
- `getTrainingNutritionTiming()`: Training-specific nutrition timing
- `getRecoveryCalorieAdjustments()`: Recovery-based calorie modifications
- `getRecoveryStatus()`: Quick recovery status assessment

**Data Quality Assessment**:
- Training load confidence scoring
- Recovery data confidence metrics
- Overall recommendation reliability calculation

### 4. EnhancedAIRecommendations Component

**UI Features**:
- **Data Quality Visualization**: Progress bars showing data confidence levels
- **Training Load Dashboard**: Acute/chronic load display with status indicators
- **Recovery Overview**: Body battery, sleep quality, and overall recovery status
- **Garmin-Specific Insights**: Training load adjustments, recovery recommendations, nutrition timing
- **Core Nutrition Display**: AI-recommended calories and macronutrients

**Interactive Elements**:
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Navigation to detailed nutrition and recovery screens
- Error handling with retry mechanisms
- Real-time data quality indicators

## 🧠 AI Enhancement Features

### Training Load Adjustments
- **High Load (>1.3 ratio)**: Increased calorie recommendations (200-400 calories)
- **Optimal Load (0.8-1.3)**: Standard recommendations with recovery considerations
- **Low Load (<0.8)**: Maintenance or slight deficit recommendations

### Recovery-Based Modifications
- **Poor Recovery**: Reduce calorie deficit by 10-15%, increase protein intake
- **High Stress**: Anti-inflammatory food focus, refined carb reduction
- **Low Body Battery**: Significant calorie increase for recovery (up to 20%)

### Training-Specific Timing
- **High-Intensity Sessions**: Pre-workout carb loading recommendations
- **Long Duration Training**: During-workout fueling strategies
- **Recovery Days**: Balanced macros with micronutrient focus

### Supplement Intelligence
- **Sleep Quality Issues**: Magnesium glycinate recommendations
- **High Training Load**: Creatine monohydrate suggestions
- **Recovery Optimization**: Targeted supplement timing

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Garmin Data Collection**: Services gather training, wellness, and sleep data
2. **Context Generation**: GarminAIContextService analyzes and structures data
3. **AI Processing**: Enhanced PerplexityService generates personalized recommendations
4. **UI Presentation**: React components display insights with data quality indicators
5. **User Interaction**: Real-time updates and navigation to detailed views

## 📊 Metrics and Monitoring

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Training Load Confidence**: Based on recent activity data availability
- **Recovery Data Confidence**: Based on wellness and sleep data completeness
- **Recommendation Reliability**: Overall confidence score for AI recommendations

### Performance Indicators
- **Confidence Levels**: High (>70%), Medium (40-70%), Low (<40%)

  duration: 120,
  intensity: 'hard'
});
```

### Recovery Status Check
```typescript
const recovery = await getRecoveryStatus(athleteProfile);
console.log(recovery.status); // 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor'
```
