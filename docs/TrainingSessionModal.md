  timestamp: Date;
  sport: SportType;
  name: string;
  duration: number; // minutes
  startTime?: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  intensity: TrainingIntensity;
  caloriesBurned: number;
  distance?: number; // km
  avgHeartRate?: number; // bpm
  maxHeartRate?: number; // bpm
  avgPower?: number; // watts
  maxPower?: number; // watts
  rpe?: number; // 1-10 scale
  notes?: string;
  equipment?: string;
  location?: string;
  weather?: string;
  mood?: 'terrible' | 'bad' | 'okay' | 'good' | 'excellent';
}
```
