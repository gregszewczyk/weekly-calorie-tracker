# Activity Caching System Implementation

## Overview
The DailyActivitySync service has been enhanced with a comprehensive activity caching system that ensures the app continues to function even when health device connections are lost.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Activity Caching**
- Activities are automatically cached when fetched from health devices
- Cache stores up to 14 days of activity data
- Duplicate activities are handled intelligently (updates existing, adds new)
- Old activities are automatically cleaned up

### 2. **Offline Fallback**
- When health device connection is lost, the app automatically falls back to cached data
- Yesterday's activities can still be synced using cached data
- Calorie calculations continue to work with cached activities

### 3. **Smart Data Management**
- Activities are stored with metadata (platform, date, cache timestamp)
- Cache automatically expires old data to prevent storage bloat
- Date-based filtering for efficient retrieval

### 4. **Proactive Caching**
- App preloads recent activities (7 days) on startup when connection is available
- Background cache updates ensure data freshness
- Manual cache refresh options for users

## New Methods Added

### Core Caching Methods
- `cacheActivities()` - Store activities locally
- `getActivityCache()` - Retrieve cached activity data
- `getCachedActivitiesForDate()` - Get activities for specific date from cache
- `clearActivityCache()` - Clear all cached data
- `getCacheStats()` - Get cache statistics for debugging

### Enhanced Sync Methods
- `preloadActivityCache()` - Proactively cache recent activities
- `syncActivityRange()` - Sync activities for a date range
- Enhanced `getActivitiesForDate()` with fallback logic

## Data Structures

### CachedActivity Interface
```typescript
interface CachedActivity {
  id: string;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format
  activity: UniversalActivity;
  cachedAt: number; // timestamp
  platform: string;
}
```

### Enhanced DailySyncStatus
```typescript
interface DailySyncStatus {
  lastSyncDate: string;
  lastSyncTimestamp: number;
  activitiesSynced: number;
  totalCaloriesBurned: number;
  syncSuccess: boolean;
  usedCachedData?: boolean;
  dataSource?: 'live_device' | 'cached_data' | 'no_data';
  error?: string;
}
```

## User Interface Enhancements

### Debug Menu Additions
- **Cache Status** - View cache statistics and manage cache
- **Clear Cache** - Remove all cached activities
- **Preload Cache** - Manually refresh activity cache
- Enhanced sync status showing data source and cache usage

## How It Works

### 1. **Normal Operation (Connected)**
1. App fetches activities from health device
2. Activities are automatically cached locally
3. Fresh data is used for all calculations
4. Cache is updated with latest activities

### 2. **Offline Operation (Disconnected)**
1. App detects no health device connection
2. Falls back to cached activities for the requested date
3. Uses cached data for calorie calculations
4. Continues normal operation with available data

### 3. **Reconnection**
1. App detects health device reconnection
2. Preloads recent activities to refresh cache
3. Resumes normal live data operation
4. Cache is updated with any new activities

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Reliability** - App works even when device is disconnected
- **Data Persistence** - Historical activities are preserved locally
- **Seamless Experience** - No interruption when connection is lost

### For Developers
- **Robust Architecture** - Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Data Integrity** - Activities are preserved across app sessions
- **Debug Tools** - Comprehensive cache management and statistics

## Storage Management
- Cache automatically cleans up activities older than 14 days
- Efficient JSON storage using AsyncStorage
- Duplicate detection prevents storage bloat
- Cache size monitoring and reporting

## Testing
Use the included `test_activity_cache.js` script to test the caching system:
```bash
node test_activity_cache.js
```

This comprehensive caching system ensures your calorie tracking app remains functional and accurate even when health device connections are intermittent or lost.
