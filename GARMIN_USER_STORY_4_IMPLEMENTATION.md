  bedTime: Date;
  wakeTime: Date;
  sleepQuality: 'poor' | 'fair' | 'good' | 'excellent';
  recoveryImpact: 'negative' | 'neutral' | 'positive';
}

interface GarminRecoveryMetrics {
  date: Date;
  recoveryScore: number; // 0-100 composite score
  recoveryStatus: 'poor' | 'fair' | 'good' | 'excellent';
  recommendations: string[];
  nutritionAdjustments: {
    calorieAdjustment: number; // percentage
    proteinBoost: boolean;
    carbAdjustment: number; // percentage
    hydrationFocus: boolean;
  };
}
```

### 4. React Integration (`src/hooks/useSleepInsights.ts`)
**Purpose**: React hooks for accessing sleep data and recommendations

### 6. CalorieStore Integration (`src/stores/calorieStore.ts`)
**Purpose**: Provide access to sleep-enhanced analysis in the main app store

**New Methods Added**:
```typescript
// Get sleep-enhanced analyzer with optional sleep service integration
getSleepEnhancedAnalyzer: () => SleepEnhancedHistoricalAnalyzer | null;

// Check if sleep data is available for enhanced analysis
isSleepDataAvailable: () => boolean;
```

**Integration Strategy**:
- Maintains compatibility with existing analyzer hierarchy
- Graceful degradation when sleep services unavailable
- Optional enhancement pattern (base → garmin-enhanced → sleep-enhanced)

## Sleep-Based Nutrition Logic

### Calorie Adjustments
1. **< 5 hours sleep**: Reduce deficit by 15% (severe deprivation)
2. **5-6 hours sleep**: Reduce deficit by 10% (moderate deprivation)  
3. **6-7 hours sleep**: Reduce deficit by 5% (mild deprivation)
4. **7-9 hours sleep**: Normal recommendations
5. **> 9 hours sleep**: Evaluate for recovery needs vs. oversleeping

### Macro Adjustments

**Protein Modifications**:
- Sleep score < 60: +15% protein boost for recovery
- Deep sleep < 15%: +15% protein boost for muscle recovery
- Poor sleep efficiency: Focus on complete proteins

**Carbohydrate Modifications**:
- Sleep < 6 hours: +15% carbs for energy restoration
- Sleep efficiency < 75%: +10% complex carbs for stable blood sugar
- Poor recovery score: Prioritize slow-release carbohydrates

**Fat Modifications**:
- Severe sleep deprivation: +5% healthy fats for hormone support
- Poor sleep quality: Focus on omega-3 rich foods
- Recovery issues: Emphasize anti-inflammatory fats

### Hydration Focus
- Activated when sleep < 7 hours OR sleep quality < 60
- Enhanced water intake recommendations
- Electrolyte balance considerations
- Caffeine timing adjustments

### Recovery Recommendations

**Sleep Duration Based**:
- < 6 hours: "Consider an earlier bedtime tonight for recovery"
- > 9 hours: "Consider if oversleeping indicates inadequate recovery"

**Sleep Quality Based**:
- Quality < 60: "Create optimal sleep environment: cool, dark, quiet"
- Poor efficiency: "Avoid screens 1 hour before bedtime"

**Recovery Score Based**:
- Score < 60: "Consider reducing training intensity today"
- Score < 40: "Focus on stress management and relaxation techniques"

### Nutrition Focus Areas

**Sleep Duration Issues**:
- "Prioritize complex carbs for stable energy"
- "Increase hydration to combat fatigue"

**Deep Sleep Issues**:
- "Include magnesium-rich foods for sleep quality"
- "Focus on lean protein for recovery"

**Sleep Quality Issues**:
- "Anti-inflammatory foods to reduce stress response"
- "Avoid late-day caffeine and heavy meals"
