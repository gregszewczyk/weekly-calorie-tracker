# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start Metro bundler
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS simulator  
- `npm run android` - Run on Android emulator
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests

For iOS development: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` (run after dependency changes)

## Architecture Overview

This is a React Native app using TypeScript that implements a weekly calorie tracking system with intelligent redistribution of daily allowances.

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **State Management**: Zustand store with persistence (`src/stores/calorieStore.ts`)
- **Business Logic**: Centralized in `WeeklyCalorieRedistributor` class (`src/utils/CalorieRedistribution.ts`)
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions in `src/types/`

### Key Business Logic: Weekly Calorie Redistribution
The core algorithm (`WeeklyCalorieRedistributor.calculateRedistribution`) redistributes remaining weekly calories across remaining days, accounting for:
- Planned training sessions (increases calories on high-intensity days)
- Minimum safe calorie thresholds (1200 calories/day)
- Weekly deficit/surplus goals
- Real-time adjustments after each meal

### State Management Architecture
The Zustand store (`useCalorieStore`) provides:
- **Computed values**: `getCurrentWeekProgress()`, `getCalorieRedistribution()`, `getRemainingCaloriesForToday()`
- **Core actions**: `logMeal()`, `updateBurnedCalories()`, `setWeeklyGoal()`
- **Persistence**: Automatically saves `currentWeekGoal` and `weeklyData`

### Key Data Flow
1. User logs meal â†’ Updates daily consumed calories
2. Store recalculates weekly progress automatically
3. Redistribution algorithm adjusts remaining daily targets
4. UI reflects updated recommendations in real-time

### Import Path Configuration
Uses TypeScript path mapping with `@types/`, `@utils/`, etc. prefixes (configured in tsconfig.json)

### Health Integration Stack
- `react-native-health` for iOS HealthKit
- `react-native-health-connect` for Android Health Connect
- `react-native-chart-kit` for data visualization
- `react-native-push-notification` for meal reminders

### Current Development Status
MVP setup is complete with core algorithm implemented. Empty directories for `components/`, `screens/`, and `services/` are ready for UI development.
