## Navigation Integration

### Access Points
1. **Apple HealthKit Sync Settings**: Export button in settings screen
2. **Direct Navigation**: `navigation.navigate('AppleHealthExport')`
3. **Modal Presentation**: Slide-up modal with export options

### Navigation Flow

## Usage Examples

### Basic Export
```typescript
const exportService = new AppleHealthExportService();

// Generate weekly report
const report = await exportService.generateWeeklyReport();

// Export to CSV
const csvPath = await exportService.exportToCSV();

// Share with healthcare provider
await exportService.shareWithHealthProvider('doctor@example.com');
```

### Data Visualization
```tsx
<HealthDataVisualization 
  report={weeklyReport} 
  onExportRequest={() => handleExport()} 
/>
```

## Mock Dependencies

For development and testing, the following mock services are implemented:

### File System Mock (RNFS)
```typescript
const RNFS = {
  DocumentDirectoryPath: '/mock/documents/',
  writeFile: async (path: string, content: string) => {
    console.log(`Mock: Writing to ${path}`);
    return Promise.resolve();
  },
  // ... other file operations
};
```

### Sharing Mock (react-native-share)
```typescript
const Share = {
  open: async (options: any) => {
    console.log('Mock: Sharing file:', options);
    return Promise.resolve({ success: true });
  }
};
```

## Data Privacy & Security

### Local Processing
- All data processing occurs locally on the device
- No external servers involved in data export
- User maintains full control over their health data

### Secure Sharing
- Healthcare provider sharing uses device email client
- Data transmitted only when explicitly authorized by user
- Sensitive health information warnings provided

### Data Validation
- Input validation for all export operations
- Error handling for file system operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Error Handling

### Export Failures
- File system permission errors
- Insufficient storage space
- Data corruption or missing data
- Network connectivity issues (for sharing)

### User Feedback
- Loading indicators during export operations
- Success/failure notifications
- Progress tracking for large exports
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for export service methods
- Integration tests for file generation
- Mock data validation tests
- Error scenario testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run export functionality tests
npm run test:export

# Test individual export formats
npm run test:csv
npm run test:xml
npm run test:json
```
